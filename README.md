# ISOM 835 – Transportation Accident Prediction Project

This repository contains the term project for **ISOM 835: Predictive Analytics & Machine Learning** at Suffolk University.  
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies **accident severity** using the Transportation & Accident Prediction dataset.  
The project follows the full data science lifecycle: EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and insights.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Explore and analyze accident-related data  
- Understand key factors influencing accident severity  
- Clean and preprocess real-world data  
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics  
- Provide insights and recommendations based on results  
- Create a portfolio-ready machine learning repository
